  File Encryption and Decryption Using Python and cryptography Library

File Encryption and Decryption Using Python and cryptography Library
====================================================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains two Python programs that utilize the cryptography library to perform encryption and decryption of files within a specified folder. Each program is described in its own section below.

### Program 1: File Encryption

#### Description

This program encrypts all files in a specified folder using a symmetric encryption key generated by the cryptography.fernet module. The key is saved to a specified path for later use during decryption.

#### How to Use

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the cryptography library installed. You can install it using pip:

```pip install cryptography ```

3.  **Modify the Script:**
    *   Set the `key_folder` variable to the path where you want to save the encryption key.
    *   Set the `folder_path` variable to the path of the folder containing files you want to encrypt.

### Program 2: File Decryption

#### Description

This program decrypts all files in a specified folder using a symmetric encryption key saved from the encryption process.

#### How to Use

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the cryptography library installed. You can install it using pip:

```pip install cryptography```

3.  **Modify the Script:**
    *   Set the `key_file_path` variable to the path where the encryption key is saved.
    *   Set the `folder_path` variable to the path of the folder containing files you want to decrypt.

### Notes

*   Ensure that the key used for decryption matches the key generated during encryption; otherwise, decryption will fail.
*   Handle the encryption key with care to avoid unauthorized access to your encrypted files.
